      <h1>Designer and Frontend Developer</h1>
      <!-- <h4>Designer and Frontend Developer</h4> -->
      <p>
        As a developer, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm
        passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites that help
        businesses and individuals achieve their goals online. However, I also
        believe that a website is only one component of a brand's online
        presence, and I'm always thinking about how I can help my clients create
        a cohesive and impactful brand experience across all channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my technical skills, I have a deep appreciation for
        design and aesthetics. I believe that a website should not only be
        functional, but also visually appealing and engaging. I'm constantly
        staying up-to-date with the latest design trends and best practices, and
        I work closely with my clients to ensure that their websites reflect
        their brand's unique personality and values.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a strong understanding of brand management and how it
        relates to web development. I understand that a website is often the
        first touchpoint that a potential customer has with a brand, and it's
        important that the website accurately reflects the brand's messaging and
        values. I work closely with my clients to ensure that their website
        aligns with their overall brand strategy and helps them achieve their
        business goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for a web developer who not only has the technical
        skills, but also a passion for design and brand management, I'd love to
        hear from you.
